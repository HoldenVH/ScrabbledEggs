# ScrabbledEggs
terminal based scrabble game </br>
Running Woo.java will generate a 15x15 Scrabble board and racks. The racks will be played by either one player and AI or by two players. The number of players will be selected in the start menu. Players will place words and receive points appropriately. The players' scores and the board will be updated and reprinted after every entry. The game will continue until one of the players decides to end the game or the bag runs out of letters. When the game stops, scores will be printed, along with a thank you message.
